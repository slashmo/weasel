## Do not use in production

üèóüë®‚Äçüéì Weasel is an HTTP Server implementation written in [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift). It's sole purpose is for me to learn about HTTP and lower-level code.

## Demo

[`Weasel`](https://github.com/slashmo/weasel/tree/master/Sources/Weasel) itself is a Swift library package that you, in theory, could **but definetely shouldn't** use in your own backend applications. Included in this repository is also an executable [`Example`](https://github.com/slashmo/weasel/tree/master/Sources/Example) which spins up an HTTP Server using the `Weasel` library.

```sh
swift package resolve
swift run
```
